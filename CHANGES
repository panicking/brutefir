BruteFIR v1.0m                                                 November 27, 2013
	 * Fixed SSE2 bug introduced in 1.0l.
	 * Added safety_limit feature to protect speakers.
	 * Fixed a rare race condition on multi-core.
	 * More sample format fixing, removed S16_4*, changed S24_4* to
	   represent low bits in sample, so it matches ALSA formats. If
	   you used S24_4LE in earlier versions you should now use S32_LE.

BruteFIR v1.0l                                                   October 6, 2013
	 * Made the code compile well on x86-64.
	 * Replaced legacy assembler code with new SSE/SSE2 C code,
	   3DNow support dropped.
	 * Fixed filter indexing bug in the 'cffa' CLI command.
	 * S24_LE now maps to Alsa SND_PCM_FORMAT_S24_3LE and S24_4LE to
	   SND_PCM_FORMAT_S24_LE (same for BE of course). Also added possibility
	   to use Alsa syntax "S24_3LE" in config file (means same as the old
	   "S24_LE").
	 * Refreshed JACK I/O module to make up to date with current API
	   versions.

	  no longer necessary to connect to external ports at startup.
	* Serial line and pipe support for the CLI module.
	* Bug fix in equaliser rendering, which was triggered in some situations
	  (thanks to Tero Kontkanen for the bug fix).

	* Got rid of BF_MAXCOEFFS (that is no longer any coeff limit).
	* The CLI module will now try to remove an existing local socket when
	  it is restarted.
	* Updated the example files xtc_config and massive_config, and included
	  two example coefficient files.

BruteFIR v1.0                                                     April 21, 2004

	  fail (used by the new OSS I/O module).
	* Now it is possible to compile on FreeBSD and Solaris again.
        * Clearer license statement (no license change though, still GPL).

BruteFIR v0.99n                                                February 22, 2004
	* Removed merge function, it was not good enough.
	* Added crossfade function which makes what the merge function did but
	  considerably better. The drawback is that roughly twice the CPU time
	  is required per filter at coefficient change (only when crossfade is
	  active of course).
	* Added a new benchmark config, bench5_config, which is a copy of
	  bench2_config but with crossfade activated and a script using it, so
	  the crossfade cost (ends up in the convolve column) can easily be
	  benchmarked.
	* Do not use posix_memalign() in buggy glibc versions.
	* Corrected ALSA pcm linking code.

BruteFIR v0.99m                                                 January 17, 2004
	* Fixed merge config bug (only activated if dither was activated too).
	* If the CLI runs in script mode, it is run directly from the filter
	  process for better timing precision, and it is now possible to sleep
	  in blocks (sleep b10; will skip ten blocks).
	* Removed truncation/extension warning when loading coefficients from
          files, and made loading more efficient (don't load whole file, only
          as much as to fill the coefficient space).
	* Fixed rare deadlock bug which could be triggered at startup.
        * Updated ALSA code to support 1.0 version of the API.
	* Replaced OOM killer hack with /proc/meminfo tracker.

BruteFIR v0.99l                                                 October 26, 2003
	* Added discontinuity merger function, which hides clicks that may occur
          when coefficients are changed in runtime.
	* Added skip feature to coeff loading, to skip given amount of bytes in
	  the beginning when loading a filter from file.
	* Fixed load balancing info bug.

	* Fixed buffer allocation bug for fftw3 plan creation.
	* Fixed ALSA I/O module logging bug.
	* Fixed another load balancing bug.
	* Fixed array overrun read bug.
	* Fixed power save bug which could cause noise output.

	* Migrated to FFTW3
	* Support for 32 bit and 64 bit precision in the same binary (use
	  the new float_bits setting).
	* Buffer underflows/overflows can optionally be ignored in the ALSA
	  I/O module, by using the new ignore_xrun setting.
	* Improved powersave function, filters will now be turned off on
	  an individual basis.
	* Issue a warning if realtime priority could not be set, instead of
	  aborting. A good behaviour in situations where root access is not
	  feasible.
	* Support for a benchmark mode (use the new benchmark setting).
	* Included some sample benchmark configuration files.
	* ALSA card linking can be disabled with the new link setting for the
	  ALSA I/O module. This is only to be used as a work-around if problems
	  are experienced when linking is used (on per default).
	* Delay buffer can now optionally be specified per virtual channel
	  with the new setting individual_maxdelay. The old maxdelay setting
	  can still be used and is interpreted as before.
	* Added version check for loadable modules
	* Added loop option to the file I/O module (for looping input).
	* Now setting proper magnitudes at equaliser edges in equaliser module.

	* Support for auto sample format (only JACK I/O module so far)
	* Real-time index and overflow detection now works with callback I/O.
	* Mixing blocking input with callback output now works.
	* Added a simple automatic load balancer for multiple CPUs.

BruteFIR v0.99g                                                 February 2, 2003

	  hardware supports natively.
	* Various latency improvements, should be less risk for underflow now.
	  Thanks to Denis Sbragion for testing on ice1712 hardware.
	* Added optional "input poll mode", which provides support for strange
	  hardware period sizes on some sound cards, and the possibility to
	  run with shorter software period size than the hardware supports.
	* Added '-nodefault' option which will make BruteFIR ignore the default
	  configuration file.
	* Properly terminate if one process is lost due to the computer is out
	  of memory or similar.
	* Try to terminate nicely when the computer runs out of memory, and
	  give a correct error code if that happens.
	* It is now possible to have more than 31 bands in the equaliser module
	  (bug fixed by Andreas Johansson).
	* Real-time index now works with sound cards again.
	* Removed bfconf_lexical.c (flex output) which mistakingly has been
	  included in the distributions.
	* Improved configuration file parser. It is now faster, and can accept
	  very large strings (with line breaks), and floating point values with
	  exponent (example -2.0e-05).
	* It is now possible to sleep in millisecond resolution in the CLI
	  module.
	* Sample clock drift check removed (did not work with new code). May
	  be added later.

BruteFIR v0.99d                                                November 28, 2002
	* Improved real-time index, much simpler and more reliable algorithm.
	* Improved filter rendering performance in equaliser module.
	* Fixed ALSA I/O module bug causing it not to work with odd sound card
	  period sizes (for example ice1712 sound cards).

	  S24_BE.
	* Fixed a couple of config file parsing bugs.
	* Corrected a slight synchronisation problem between input and output.
	* Reduced risk of buffer underflow at startup.
	* Fixed bug (outdated input buffers) when changing coefficients in
	  partitioned convolution when coefficients are of different lengths.

BruteFIR v0.99b                                               September 12, 2002
	* Fixed bug which caused buffer underflow in ALSA I/O module when
	  software buffer is larger than hardware buffer.
	* Linking problem with ALSA module resolved.

BruteFIR v0.99a                                                  August 25, 2002
	* Attach coefficient shared memory segments with read/write permissions
	  at all times in order to allow modules such as "eq" to operate on
	  them.

BruteFIR v0.99                                                    August 4, 2002
	* Fixed I/O delay ("fixed" as in constant, not as in "fixed a bug").
	  For properly designed sound cards, the I/O delay will always be
	  exactly twice the filter block length.
	* An equaliser module is now included. Equalisation can be changed in
	  runtime through the CLI.
	* Slight change in configuration file format in order to support
	  advanced configuration of modules.
	* Some bug fixes.

BruteFIR v0.98e                                                    July 26, 2002
	* Added the possibility to scale input/outputs with negative values

BruteFIR v0.98d                                                    July 21, 2002

	* Fixed mixbuffer assignment bug (caused looping sound with some
	  filter configurations)
	* Fixed large integer parsing bug
	* Added runtime FFTW link check to see if the common mistake linking
	  32 bit BruteFIR with 64 bit FFTW (or the other way around) has been
	  made.

BruteFIR v0.98b                                                      May 5, 2002

	* Fixed bug which sometimes left a stray process after exit
	* Improved real-time index calculation to handle SMP properly
	* Measure sample rate and exit if it is altered during runtime
	* The program now has meaningful exit codes (exited due to sample rate
	  change, out of memory, buffer underflow etc)

BruteFIR v0.98                                                    March 25, 2002

	  structures)
	* Support for muting input channels (also in CLI, new 'tmi' command)
	* Support for the old skip and append parameters in bfio_file module
	* Fixed error message passing bug in ALSA code	
	* Fixed double close bug

BruteFIR v0.97d                                                December 20, 2001

	* Added support for -quiet parameter to suppress title and warnings
	
BruteFIR v0.97c                                                December 17, 2001
        * ALSA I/O module now accepts raw ALSA device names as module parameter.
	  If you want to do the same thing as before, just at "hw:" at the
	  start of the string, forming "alsa"/"hw:0,0" for example.
	  
BruteFIR v0.97b                                                December 16, 2001
	* Added new sample formats S24_4LE/BE and S16_4LE/BE
	* Fixed I/O module load bug (if two types of modules was mixed, the
	  program crashed)
	* Fixed integer overflow bug for 32 bit formats (caused clipping to
	  fail with disasterous results: a loud tone instead of proper
	  clipping on overflow)
	* Fixed overflow update bug
	* Fixed missing error message bug in ALSA I/O module
	* Added check for dither feasibility
	
BruteFIR v0.97a                                                December 14, 2001
	* Fixed dither bug (if dither not activated, the program crashed)
	* Fixed default file parse bug (channel fields without '/' lead to
	  crash)
	* Fixed mute array parse bug (all output structures shared the same
	  mute array)
	* Support for short delay arrays in the configuration files, now they
	  are extended with zeros (instead of calling it a parse error)

BruteFIR v0.97                                                  December 9, 2001

	  support for adaptive filtering and other things through logic 
	  modules.
	* ALSA and raw PCM support now in I/O modules.
	* CLI is in a logic module.
	* Changed sample format strings, example: "16s2l0" is now "S16_LE".

BruteFIR v0.96                                                   August 20, 2001
	* It is now possible to make filter networks, that is put filters in
	  series, and so on, as long as no loops are made.
	* Variable length filters (actually variable length coefficient sets).
	* Predelay per filter setting.
	* Fixed mute setting bug.
	* Fixed severe digital audio setup bug.
	
BruteFIR v0.95b                                                    July 18, 2001
        * Thanks to Doug Kelly a severe bug (block bounds violation) in the 
	  conversion from 32 bit to floating point format was found and fixed.
	* Realtime priorites of the processes was changed, in order to keep
	  the CLI responsive even in realtime operation. This may be bad for 
	  extremely low latencies (sub 100 ms), haven't tested that. It is 
	  utterly necessary for higher latencies though.
		  
BruteFIR v0.95a                                                     June 3, 2001
        * Fixed severe bug in raw filter reading (caused core dump with long
	  filters).
	* Added lock_memory parameter, so the mlock call can be controlled (it
	  is unnecessary to run mlock when there is no swap, and mlock can think
	  it is out of memory when lots of shared memory is used(?) ).
	
BruteFIR v0.95                                                      May 26, 2001
	* Updated ALSA support, non-interleaved hardware (like RME9652) is now
	  supported.
	* Updated and added some CLI commands.
	* Added support for delay changes in runtime.
	* Added support for giving shared memory references for coefficient
	  sets, which is useful when using BruteFIR from another program.
	* Fixed severe bug which caused choppy sound when combining files with
	  sound cards for inputs/outputs.
	* Improved the Makefile.
	  
BruteFIR v0.94a                                                   April 11, 2001
        * Fixed a severe bug in the ALSA support code, which caused BruteFIR to 
	  report "Hardware does not support enough fragments" together with
	  common sound cards.

BruteFIR v0.94                                                     April 8, 2001
        * New convolution algorithm which allows for even higher output. Hand-
          coded assembler optimisations for SSE and 3DNow are included (also 
          for x87, but that code is naive and slow).
        * Now it is possible to mute channels from the CLI.
        * Configuration file can be read from stdin (filename = stdin)
        * Some bugfixes.

BruteFIR v0.93                                                     March 3, 2001

	* Fixed bug causing long delays not to work.
	* ALSA support updated.
	* Made double precision compilation the default.
	
BruteFIR v0.91a                                                 January 30, 2001
	* Fixed a major bug, channels could be lost when running in more
	  than one process, which could for example result in mono playback.
	
BruteFIR v0.91                                                  January 28, 2001
	* ALSA support updated
	* Added nosound target to makefile 'make brutefir_nosound'
	* Mixing and volume now applied in the frequency domain, which leads to
	  large performance improvements for common configurations
	* Improved realtime reliability through better process synchronisation
	  and setting processes to realtime priority
	* Some code cleanups
	
BruteFIR v0.9                                                   January 15, 2001
	* ALSA support implemented (ALSA v0.6, that is the CVS version)
	* Isolated FFT and sound card interfaces so it should be simple to port
	  to use other FFT libraries / sound card APIs.
	* Some code cleanups

BruteFIR v0.6                                                   January 13, 2001
	* Dither support implemented (high pass TPDF)
	* Sample requantisation now works as a proper mid-tread requantiser
	* Optimised delay buffer handling when delays are short
	* Fixed minor bugs in sample format parsing/conversion
	* Some code cleanups

BruteFIR v0.52                                                   January 8, 2001
	* Now conversion to and from all supported raw sample formats should be 
	  complete and correct for both little and big endian architectures.

BruteFIR v0.51                                                   January 7, 2001
	* Added customisable delay for input and output channels
	* Removed some meaningless settings from configuration
	* Added printout of I/O-delay approximation
	* Fixed file ending bug
	
BruteFIR v0.5                                                    January 6, 2001
	* Initial release. No ALSA support yet.
